# Math 205 Project

Welcome to the **Math 205 Project**! This project is part of the Math 205 course and demonstrates the application of mathematical concepts through a series of algorithms and computations. The main objective of this project is to solve complex mathematical problems using Python, including matrix operations, linear algebra, and data analysis.

## Features

- **Matrix Operations**: Perform various matrix operations such as multiplication, addition, and inversion.
- **Linear Algebra**: Solve systems of linear equations using Gaussian elimination and other methods.
- **Data Analysis**: Use Python to analyze mathematical datasets, visualize data, and perform calculations.

## Installation

Before running this project, ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You’ll need:

1. `numpy` - for matrix operations and mathematical calculations.
2. `matplotlib` - for data visualization.
3. `pandas` - for data manipulation and analysis.

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas
````

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
